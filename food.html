    <p>"Now I was a little nervous about being able to find food
     that I would like. I basically lived off of chips and guacomole
     for the week. Hands down the best guac I have ever had"

    "They have some American food like hotdogs, hamburgers, fries,
    and pizza. So you always had some options if you didn't like
    what was for dinner that night"  </p>
